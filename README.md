# ZombieClash
Minecraft minigame made using the Spigot API (1.16.5)

## Details
### Introduction
  The minigame is a **4 player turn based** minigame in which each player spends **elixir** and **tokens** to attack others with mobs and to create defences to prevent them from being attacked. The aim of the game is to attack others until they lose all their health. There are 5 rounds of major changes (each round lasts 8 turns).

### Attacking
  Each player can choose who they want to attack and which lane they want to attack down. They can choose different lanes for each mob they choose. Each mob costs a certain amount of elixir and tokens. Mobs can be upgraded using **upgrade points¹**.

### Defending
  There will be 3 options for defence.
  - Double defence
  - Single defence
  - No defence

  The **double defence** will block the central lane. The **single defence** will block only one of the side lanes. The **no defence** options exists incase people want to save up tokens for **upgrade points**. Each defence can only block a certain number of mobs. Like mobs, they also cost elixir and tokens; and can be upgraded using **upgrade points**.

¹ Tokens at the end of each round are converted into Upgrade Points.
